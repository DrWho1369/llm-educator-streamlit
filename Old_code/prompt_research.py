Prompt engineering techniques can be grouped into several categories:

### 🔹 **Instruction-based Techniques**
- Clear role assignment (e.g., “You are a helpful teaching assistant…”)
- Task decomposition (multi-step instructions)
- Output formatting (e.g., bullet points, markdown)

### 🔹 **Cognitive Scaffolding Techniques**
- **Chain-of-Thought prompting** – Encourage step-by-step reasoning
- Socratic-style prompting – Have the LLM generate clarifying questions
- Self-evaluation prompting – Ask the LLM to assess or reflect on its own response

### 🔹 **Few-shot / Zero-shot Prompting**
- Provide examples (few-shot)
- Rely on generalization (zero-shot)

### 🔹 **Role & Persona Conditioning**
- Give the model a professional identity (e.g., teacher, examiner)
- Aligns tone and vocabulary to the user’s expectations

### 🔹 **Constraint-based Prompting**
- Define output structure, tone, or style strictly
- Limit responses (e.g., “no more than 100 words”, “bullet points only”)

## 🧠 Prompt Techniques Overview

### Instruction-Based
- Clear role assignment  
- Step-by-step decomposition  
- Output format guidance  

### Cognitive Scaffolding
- Chain-of-thought  
- Socratic prompting  
- Self-evaluation  

### Few-shot & Zero-shot
- Use of example inputs  
- Generalized task specification  

### Role Conditioning
- Assign persona (e.g. 'You are an examiner')  
- Align tone with audience  

### Constraints
- Word limits, style limits  
- Required sections / formatting  

## 🏆 Top 5 Prompt Techniques

| Rank | Technique                  | Description                                         | Why It's Effective                            |
|------|----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|
| 1    | Explicit Role Assignment   | Set identity of the model                          | Aligns language, reduces ambiguity             |
| 2    | Step-by-Step Instructions | Provide clear ordered steps                        | Improves structure and focus                   |
| 3    | Structured Output Format   | Require specific formatting (e.g. slides)          | Makes output easier to use or copy             |
| 4    | Chain-of-Thought Prompting | Ask the LLM to reason through steps                | Helps with logical consistency and accuracy    |
| 5    | Variable Injection         | Insert custom info like age or topic               | Tailors outputs directly to user needs         |
